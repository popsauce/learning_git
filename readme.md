# Learning Git Basics
## 0) Github Lingo

## 1) Repositories

Repositories are sites which are used either as a folder or as a project area. Some differences that differentiate a repository from a folder are features like branches, cloning, pull requests, etc which is very helpful when collaborating with a lot of people as it enables multiple clones/forks that can continue parallel to each other or merge depending on the use of the commit.
